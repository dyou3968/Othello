    By David You and Sean Swayze

Description: Our goal with this project is to recreate the othello board game in pygame. We also added
    in additional algorithms to increase complexity and eventually allow it to be online multiplayer.

Run Project:
    Users simply have to run the 'othello.py' file

Project Libraries:
    pygame

Future Goals:
    Fix bugs with minimax algorithm
    Implement a monte carlo search algorithm
    Add different levels of difficulties
    Create a better user interface
    Add online multiplayer features across computers
